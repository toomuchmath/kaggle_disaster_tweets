# NLP with Disaster Tweets
This is a project based on a 
[kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview) 
that requires participants to predict which tweets are about real disasters and which are not. The dataset
was originally created by figure-eight and is available for download on their
[website](https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/).
